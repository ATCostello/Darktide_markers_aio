# Darktide mod: Markers Improved All-in-One

Link to modpage:
https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/447

I always like being able to customise icons, which is why I have made all of my "Markers" series of mods.

This mod combines all of these "Markers" mods into one, easy to use, track and configure mod. Plus, due to having all the marker's logic in one place - Markers AIO is much better optimised when compared to using all the individual modules together.

It's important to note that there are a lot of configurable options in the DMF settings page for this mod! Do check them out if you would like to adjust anything, and let me know if there are more options you would like. Also, please take the time to read at least this description page fully, thanks, and enjoy!

Configurable options include: Adjusting view distance, adjusting line of sight requirement, opacity, colour, size... plus many more!

A quick rundown of the mods (and main features) included:

Ammo and Medical Markers

Adds a distinct icon above each of the following:

    Ammo pickups (small and large)
    Grenades
    Ammo Crates (Displays charges left)
    Medical Crates (Displays amount used)

Also includes:

    Full customisation of the max distance, scale, alpha and RGB.
    Automatic adjustment of background colour of ammo crate icon depending on charges (Green > yellow > orange > red).
    Displays charges left of ammo crates and med stations.
    Shows percentage left on med crates (Only in private lobbies atm, can't seem to get it to work on live)
    Shows the proximity radius of med crates.
    Crate icons will change to a red border (and an optional extra icon) if a friendly Veteran has the "Field Improvisation" talent active.
    Med crate proximity ring colour also adjusts for Field Improvisation.

 

Chest Markers﻿

    Adds icons above chests to display their contents. (Only works in solo lobbies)
    Removes the chest interaction icon if the chest is empty. (Only works in solo lobbies)
    Adds a (optional) unique icon to each chest instead of the default interact icon.
    Full customisation of the max distance, scale, alpha and RGB.


(Unfortunately, the preview icons only work in solo lobbies due to the chest contents in live games being - understandably - stored and locked on the Fatshark servers.) 

Heretical Idol Markers﻿

    Adds a distinct marker icon above heretical idols.
    Uses optional "keep on screen" tracking to point to the direction of the heretical idol. (Useful when the idol is behind/above you!)
    Full customisation of the max distance, scale, alpha and RGB colour value of the marker.﻿



Material Markers

Adds a distinct icon above each of the following:

    Plasteel (Red by default)
    Diamantine (Blue by default)
    Small material pickups (Distinguish via a silver trim)
    Large material pickups (Distinguish via a golden trim)

    Full customisation of the max distance, scale, alpha and RGB of both diamantine and plasteel pickups.

 

Stimm Markers

    Adds a distinct icon above each stimm, with a distinct colour for easy tracking.
    Full customisation of the max distance, scale, alpha and RGB.
    Adjusts the held stimm inventory icon colour to match
    Adjusts team panel HUD held stimms colour to match



Tome and Relic Markers﻿

    Adds a distinct icon above tomes and relics.
    Uses optional "keep on screen" tracking to point to the direction of the collectable.
    Full customisation of the max distance, scale, alpha and RGB colour value of the marker.

 
Live Event Markers﻿

    A customised version of all my smaller, live event focused markers mods.
    Includes icons for Tainted Devices, Tainted Skulls, Nurgle Totems and more as live events are made!




All modules can be toggled on/off in the in-game DML mod settings page, along with options to customise max distance, colour, alpha and more.
For more info, check out the modules individual pages.

Compatibility note
This All-in-One replaces each of my individual "Marker" mods. Please uninstall all individual mods listed above before installing.

If you use FoundYa, my Marker mods will use the distance sliders from that mod instead of my own (For consistency between icon distances) although, Markers all in one should ideally replace FoundYa, to make use of this mod's settings fully.

As of update 1.0.3, Ration Pack and Stimms Pickup Icon are no longer compatible, as Markers AIO has a lot of overlapping functionality.

I would like to acknowledge the excellent mods:

Ration Pack by Wobin, which has a similar functionality for crates.

Stimms Pickup Icon by deluxghost: which has similar functionality for recolouring stimms.

My mod accomplishes a similar end result, although each mod has their additional features and drawbacks from each other.

This mod was developed so that my "Marker" series has complete coverage, and using only my own assets & creations (unless stated otherwise) not in spite of other mods/mod authors. Thanks :)
